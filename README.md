# NBA-API-Data-Getter
Gets player season stats with sqlite into a .db file around 23,000 lines

HOW TO USE:
1. Let the get data.py file run, it will automatically handle errors and give you info on whats going on
2. At around ever 600 players it will start to time out. To combat this at the end of the batch it will wait a set amount of second before restaing the data collection.

DISCLAIMER:
You may need to change the file path variables as it could be set up different for you
